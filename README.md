This test Django app was built following the 7 part tutorial from the Django documentation https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial07/

There is no custom code in this repo.  This app uses the code given in the tutorial.


The tutorial walks through setting up a simple poll taking app, working with models, views and routes (url.py and URLconf). Basic testing is covered and manipulation and use of the admin panel.
